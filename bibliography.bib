	abstract = {Presently, smartphones are used more and more for purposes that have nothing to do with phone calls or simple data transfers. One example is the recognition of human activity, which is relevant information for many applications in the domains of medical diagnosis, elderly assistance, indoor localization, and navigation. The information captured by the inertial sensors of the phone (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) can be analyzed to determine the activity performed by the person who is carrying the device, in particular in the activity of walking. Nevertheless, the development of a standalone application able to detect the walking activity starting only from the data provided by these inertial sensors is a complex task. This complexity lies in the hardware disparity, noise on data, and mostly the many movements that the smartphone can experience and which have nothing to do with the physical displacement of the owner. In this work, we explore and compare several approaches for identifying the walking activity. We categorize them into two main groups: the first one uses features extracted from the inertial data, whereas the second one analyzes the characteristic shape of the time series made up of the sensors readings. Due to the lack of public datasets of inertial data from smartphones for the recognition of human activity under no constraints, we collected data from 77 different people who were not connected to this research. Using this dataset, which we published online, we performed an extensive experimental validation and comparison of our proposals.},

	abstract = {Gait patterns are a result of the complex kinematics that enable human two-legged locomotion, and they can reveal a lot about a person’s state and health. Analysing them is useful for researchers to get new insights into the course of diseases, and for physicians to track the progress after healing from injuries. When a person walks and is interfered with in any way, the resulting disturbance can show up and be found in the gait patterns. This paper describes an experimental setup for capturing gait patterns with a capacitive sensor floor, which can detect the time and position of foot contacts on the floor. With this setup, a dataset was recorded where 42 participants walked over a sensor floor in different modes, inter alia, normal pace, closed eyes, and dual-task. A recurrent neural network based on Long Short-Term Memory units was trained and evaluated for the classification task of recognising the walking mode solely from the floor sensor data. Furthermore, participants were asked to do the Unilateral Heel-Rise Test, and their gait was recorded before and after doing the test. Another neural network instance was trained to predict the number of repetitions participants were able to do on the test. As the results of the classification tasks turned out to be promising, the combination of this sensor floor and the recurrent neural network architecture seems like a good system for further investigation leading to applications in health and care.},

	abstract = {Real-world walking data offers rich insights into a person’s mobility. Yet, daily life variations can alter these patterns, making the data challenging to interpret. As such, it is essential to integrate context for the extraction of meaningful information from real-world movement data. In this work, we leveraged the relationship between the characteristics of a walking bout and context to build a classification algorithm to distinguish between indoor and outdoor walks. We used data from 20 participants wearing an accelerometer on the thigh over a week. Their walking bouts were isolated and labeled using GPS and self-reporting data. We trained and validated two machine learning models, random forest and ensemble Support Vector Machine, using a leave-one-participant-out validation scheme on 15 subjects. The 5 remaining subjects were used as a testing set to choose a final model. The chosen model achieved an accuracy of 0.941, an F1-score of 0.963, and an AUROC of 0.931. This validated model was then used to label the walks from a different dataset with 15 participants wearing the same accelerometer. Finally, we characterized the differences between indoor and outdoor walks using the ensemble of the data. We found that participants walked significantly faster, longer, and more continuously when walking outdoors compared to indoors. These results demonstrate how movement data alone can be used to obtain accurate information on important contextual factors. These factors can then be leveraged to enhance our understanding and interpretation of real-world movement data, providing deeper insights into a person’s health.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, decreasing physical activity has emerged as one of the major issues affecting human health since people increasingly engaged in sedentary behavior in their homes and workplaces. In physical activity research, using GPS trajectories and advanced GIS methods has a potential for greatly enhancing our understanding of the association between objectively measured moderate and vigorous physical activity and physical and social environments. Relying only on objectively measured physical activity intensity, however, ignores the role of different places and types of physical activity on people's health outcomes. The aim of this study is to propose an approach to classifying physical activity in free-living conditions for physical activity research using published smartphone accelerometer data. Random forest and gradient boosting are used to predict jogging, walking, sitting, and standing. Generated training models based on the two classifiers are tested on accelerometer data collected from the smartphones of two subjects in free-living conditions. GPS trajectories with predicted physical activity labels are visually explored on a map to offer new insight on the assessment of the predicted results of daily activities and the identification of any difference in the results between random forest and gradient boosting. The findings of this study indicate that random forest and gradient boosting enable accurate physical activity classification in free-living conditions. GPS trajectories linked with predicted labels on a map assist the visual exploration of the erroneous prediction in daily activities including in-vehicle activities.},

	abstract = {An abundance of GPS data on walking and cycling requires substantial data processing – a primary component of which is trip identification to distinguish between data recorded during travel versus activities. The objective of this paper is to systematically evaluate trip identification algorithms in the literature and provide recommendations to improve performance for walking and cycling trips. Fourteen algorithms are applied to 1685 GPS trajectories from Vancouver, Canada, and evaluated on the bases of their agreement, distinction of trip and activity data characteristics, processing time, and accuracy (based on a labeled subset). Error sources are identified in relationship to trajectory, network, and weather factors. Results indicate poor concordance and widely varying performance, with no algorithm best across all measures. Four high-performing algorithms are identified with at least 90\% record-level accuracy; other considerations include accuracy of the inferred number and duration of trips, precision of identified trip end points, and computational resource requirements. Density is a key variable for trip identification in the best-performing algorithms. Proximity to tree canopy, buildings, bridges, and tunnels affects the accuracy of some algorithms more than others. Most algorithms err almost entirely with false trips or false activities, which is a bias of concern for analysis. The importance of trip identification decisions should motivate more thorough reporting to enhance reproducibility and reliability.},

	abstract = {Animal-borne sensors enable researchers to remotely track animals, their physiological state and body movements. Accelerometers, for example, have been used in several studies to measure body movement, posture, and energy expenditure, although predominantly in marine animals. In many studies, behaviour is often inferred from expert interpretation of sensor data and not validated with direct observations of the animal. The aim of this study was to derive models that could be used to classify oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) behaviour based on sensor data. We measured the location, speed, and tri-axial acceleration of three oystercatchers using a flexible GPS tracking system and conducted simultaneous visual observations of the behaviour of these birds in their natural environment. We then used these data to develop three supervised classification trees of behaviour and finally applied one of the models to calculate time-activity budgets. The model based on accelerometer data developed to classify three behaviours (fly, terrestrial locomotion, and no movement) was much more accurate (cross-validation error = 0.14) than the model based on GPS-speed alone (cross-validation error = 0.35). The most parsimonious acceleration model designed to classify eight behaviours could distinguish five: fly, forage, body care, stand, and sit (cross-validation error = 0.28); other behaviours that were observed, such as aggression or handling of prey, could not be distinguished. Model limitations and potential improvements are discussed. The workflow design presented in this study can facilitate model development, be adapted to a wide range of species, and together with the appropriate measurements, can foster the study of behaviour and habitat use of free living animals throughout their annual routine.},

	abstract = {The ecological literature reveals considerable confusion about the meaning of validation in the context of simulation models. The confusion arises as much from semantic and philosophical considerations as from the selection of validation procedures. Validation is not a procedure for testing scientific theory or for certifying the ‘truth’ of current scientific understanding, nor is it a required activity of every modelling project. Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements. Before validation is undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria, and (3) the model context must be specified. The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts. Different tests and standards are applied to the operational, theoretical, and data components. The operational and data components can be validated; the theoretical component cannot. The most common problem with ecological and environmental models is failure to state what the validation criteria are. Criteria must be explicitly stated because there are no universal standards for selecting what test procedures or criteria to use for validation. A test based on comparison of simulated versus observed data is generally included whenever possible. Because the objective and subjective components of validation are not mutually exclusive, disagreements over the meaning of validation can only be resolved by establishing a convention.},

	abstract = {To investigate the association between physical activity (including active travel modes) and environmental factors, much research has estimated contextual inﬂuences based on zones or areas delineated with buﬀer analysis. However, few studies to date have examined the eﬀects of diﬀerent buﬀer sizes on estimates of individuals’ dynamic exposures along their daily trips recorded as GPS trajectories. Thus, using a 7-day GPS dataset collected in the Chicago Regional Household Travel Inventory (CRHTI) Survey, this study addresses the methodological issue of how the associations between environmental contexts and active travel modes (ATMs) as a subset of physical activity vary with GPS-based buﬀer size. The results indicate that buﬀer size inﬂuences such associations and the signiﬁcance levels of the seven environmental factors selected as predictors. Further, the ﬁndings on the eﬀects of buﬀer size on such associations and the signiﬁcance levels are clearly diﬀerent between the ATMs of walking and biking. Such evidence of the existence of buﬀer-size eﬀects for multiple environmental factors not only conﬁrms the importance of the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP) but provides a resounding cautionary note to all future research on human mobility involving individuals’ GPS trajectories, including studies on physical activity and travel behaviors, especially on the reliable estimation of individual exposures to environmental factors and their health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Identification of active or sedentary modes of transport is of relevance for studies assessing physical activity or addressing exposure assessment. We assessed in a proof-of-principle study if speed as logged by GPSs could be used to identify modes of transport (walking, bicycling, and motorized transport: car, bus or train).
Methods: 12 persons commuting to work walking, bicycling or with motorized transport carried GPSs for two commutes and recorded their mode of transport. We evaluated seven speed metrics: mean, 95th percentile of speed, standard deviation of the mean, rate-of-change, standardized-rate-of-change, acceleration and deceleration. We assessed which speed metric would best identify the transport mode using discriminant analyses. We applied cross validation and calculated agreement (Cohen’s Kappa) between actual and derived modes of transport.
Results: Mode of transport was reliably classified whenever a person used a mode of transport for longer than one minute. Best results were observed when using the 95th percentile of speed, acceleration and deceleration (kappa 0.73). When we combined all motorized traffic into one category, kappa increased to 0.95.
Conclusions: GPS-measured speed enable the identification of modes of transport. Given the current low costs of GPS devices and the built-in capacity of GPS tracking in most smartphones, the use of such devices in large epidemiological studies may facilitate the assessment of physical activity related to transport modes, or improve exposure assessment using automated travel mode detection.},

	abstract = {Data representing the trajectories of moving point objects are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in GIScience, and are the focus of much methodological research aimed at extracting patterns and meaning describing the underlying phenomena. However, current research within GIScience in this area has largely ignored issues related to scale and granularity – in other words how much are the patterns that we see a function of the size of the looking glass that we apply? In this article we investigate the implications of varying the temporal scale at which three movement parameters, speed, sinuosity and turning angle are derived, and explore the relationship between this temporal scale and uncertainty in the individual data points making up a trajectory. A very rich dataset, representing the movement of 10 cows over some two days every 0.25 s is investigated. Our cross-scale analysis shows ﬁrstly, that movement parameters for all 10 cows are broadly similar over a range of scales when the data are segmented to remove quasi-static subtrajectories. However, by exploring realistic values of GPS uncertainty using Monte Carlo Simulation, it becomes apparent that ﬁne scale measurement of all movement parameters is masked by uncertainties, and that we can only make meaningful statements about movement when we take these uncertainties into account.},

	abstract = {The two algorithms discussed in this book were proposed by Leo Breiman: CART trees, which were introduced in the mid-1980s, and random forests, which emerged just under 20 years later in the early 2000s. This chapter offers an introduction to the subject matter, beginning with a historical overview. Some notations, used to define the various statistical objectives addressed in the book, are also introduced: classification, regression, prediction, and variable selection. In turn, the three R packages used in the book are listed, and some competitors are mentioned. Lastly, the four datasets used to illustrate the methods’ application are presented: the running example (spam), a genomic dataset, and two pollution datasets (ozone and dust).},

	abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is increasingly used in health research to capture individual mobility and contextual and environmental exposures. However, the tools, techniques and decisions for using GPS data vary from study to study, making comparisons and reproducibility challenging.
Objectives The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) identify best practices for GPS data collection and processing; (2) quantify reporting of best practices in published studies; and (3) discuss examples found in reviewed manuscripts that future researchers may employ for reporting GPS data usage, processing and linkage of GPS data in health studies.
Design A systematic review.
Data sources Electronic databases searched (24 October 2023) were PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022322166).
Eligibility criteria Included peer-reviewed studies published in English met at least one of the criteria: (1) protocols involving GPS for exposure/context and human health research purposes and containing empirical data; (2) linkage of GPS data to other data intended for research on contextual influences on health; (3) associations between GPS-measured mobility or exposures and health; (4) derived variable methods using GPS data in health research; or (5) comparison of GPS tracking with other methods (eg, travel diary).
Data extraction and synthesis We examined 157 manuscripts for reporting of best practices including wear time, sampling frequency, data validity, noise/signal loss and data linkage to assess risk of bias.
Results We found that 6\% of the studies did not disclose the GPS device model used, only 12.1\% reported the per cent of GPS data lost by signal loss, only 15.7\% reported the per cent of GPS data considered to be noise and only 68.2\% reported the inclusion criteria for their data.
Conclusions Our recommendations for reporting on GPS usage, processing and linkage may be transferrable to other geospatial devices, with the hope of promoting transparency and reproducibility in this research.
