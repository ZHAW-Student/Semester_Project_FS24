| **Data:**      | What type of data are you focussing on?  |
| **Title:**     | The title of your project                |
| **Student 1:** | Saskia Gianola                           |
| **Student 2:** | Sarah Wirth                              |

## Abstract 
Based on movement data we want to derive the purpose of the movement. Using the attributes sinuosity, speed and number of stops we want to find out whether an activity belongs to commuting path, is recreational or belongs to running an errand for example grocery shopping. 

## Research Questions
Is it possible to derive the type of activity from movement data considering the attributes sinuosity, speed and visited locations?

## Results / products
We expect to be able to distinguish between different types of activity data. The trajectories are expected to differ regarding sinuosity, speed and number of stops. 

## Data
We use the activity data from Saskia and if we would be able to get additional walking data from other students that would be ideal. 

## Analytical concepts
Similarity measures
Raw characteristics such as sinuosity, speed and number of stops.
Visual comparison with timecubes

## R concepts
<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
<!-- What could be the biggest challenges/problems you might face? What is your plan B? -->

## Questions? 
<!-- Which questions would you like to discuss at the coaching session? -->
